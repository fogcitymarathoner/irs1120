Quickbooks/Filemaker port to Rails3/Postgres9 of an annual corporate taxe return.

I've owned a corporation for 16 years.  At first I paid CPA's to draft the returns, then used excel spread sheets, then I used Turbo Tax, then during hardtimes used Filemaker.  So this would be my 3rd rewrite of a basic 1120 form.
